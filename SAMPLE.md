# Project-01

Relates to easy learning about the combined use of VS Code & Github for creating repositories.

## Start creating

Hands on > Start creating your "first_repo" locally from VS Code IDE EXPLORER purpose folder.

Pre-requisites: Manage to have current versions of VS Code+Git-Github installed in your workplace. See Ref.#1

Create an "index.html" file in the selected folder by typing html in the code pane, select html:5
Type add a title # Markdown heading <"h1>Inline HTML heading</h1> within the <"head>..section..</head> and save this index.html file
Install Live Server Extension in VS Code (Ctrl+Shift+X), note "Go Live" button at bottom right
Click on Go Live to see your webpage initial status in the Server.

Go to GIT Source Control in VS Code (Ctrl+Shift+G G) and click on Initialize this repository.
Stage changes by clicking + on the highlighted file changes and then click on the Commit button.
Add your comment on the action being updated, save the comment (Ctrl+S) and verify your Github repository.

Code in your "index.html" file can be improved by adding a "Stylesheet" link below the <"title>, next under the <"body> <"main"> section you can insert an image <"image src=""..image link..> of convenient size to suit your page view, also insert section heading(s) with text <"h1>..Text1..</h1>, <"h2>..Text2..</h2>, a <"span>..element..</span>, a paragraph <"p>..content..</p>, an <"ul>..parent element..</ul> with a list <2li>..of items..</li>, as well as an inner hyperlink <"a href="https://"> plus a space-separated list of the classes of the element <"i class="bi bi-github icon"></i>, make sure that all </li>, </ul>, </main>, </body> elements have the correct indent closure and save the </html> file.

Verify changes on your webpage perform any necessary adjustments (+) and Commit the repository in the VS Code IDE after Message (Ctrl+Enter). Later on verify new commits added to your user URL in Github.
